## What This Is

The Faith Gap Framework is a multi-disciplinary behavioral science model that explains
why partners, family members, and loved ones exhibit skepticism during extended career
uncertainty — and why that skepticism is **not** a character deficiency, a gender trait,
or a loyalty failure.

It is a **structural information deficit**.

The person expressing doubt simply hasn't accumulated the same evidence base that the
job-seeker has built across 25+ years of navigating recessions, pivots, and recoveries.
The gap is real, measurable, and — critically — closeable.

## The Three-Variable Diagnostic Model

| Variable | Description | Modifiable? |
|---|---|---|
| **Relationship Tenure** | Limited contextual history in early-stage partnerships | ✓ Yes — time |
| **Attachment Style** | Anxious attachment activates hypervigilant stress under uncertainty | ✓ Yes — couples work |
| **Breadwinner Norms** | Cultural expectations amplify psychological stakes for both partners | ✓ Yes — naming + context |

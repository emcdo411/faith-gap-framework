# Methodology: How the Faith Gap Framework Was Built

## The Practical Data Evangelist Approach

This framework was not generated by AI. It was **stress-tested by AI**.

### Step 1 — Hypothesis Formation (Human)
Twenty-five years of lived experience navigating economic cycles, recessions,
technological disruption, and personal reinvention produced a repeating pattern:
people close to resilient individuals often carry MORE anxiety than the resilient
person — not because of character failure, but because they lack the same evidence base.

### Step 2 — Truth Lens Scoring (KenSight v3.5)
Cross-disciplinary evidential truth score applied across 6 domains:
- Each domain scored 0–100
- Minimum defensible threshold for causal claims: 80/100
- Faith Gap Framework cleared 80/100 in all 6 domains (avg: 88/100)

### Step 3 — Citation Tier Audit (Research Analyzer v1.0)
Every source assigned a tier rating:
- Tier 1: Peer-reviewed journals, RCTs, meta-analyses
- Tier 2: Replicated studies, working papers
- Tier 3: Theoretical frameworks (max acceptable: 5)
- Result: 16 Tier 1 | 4 Tier 2 | 1 Tier 3 | Score: 92/100

### Step 4 — Belief Perseverance Stress Test (Snowflake Equation Lab v2)
Validated that the Faith Gap belief is Type 1 (information-responsive):
- Belief Flexibility: 75/100 — above the 25/100 minimum for information-based change
- Confirms: information delivery IS the correct intervention class

### Step 5 — Structural Force Audit (Westwood Correction)
Verified that structural forces are not overwhelming individual-level intervention:
- Structural Amplification Score: 67/100
- Below 80/100 threshold where individual interventions become contraindicated
- Confirms: the framework can work

## AI Role in This Process

AI was used to:
- Run quality control instruments
- Surface counter-arguments and alternative explanations
- Identify missing variables
- Find disciplines where the framework wouldn't hold
- Map confirmation bias risk areas

AI was NOT used to:
- Form the core hypothesis
- Generate the lived experience evidence base
- Replace analytical judgment
- Produce conclusions without human validation

"A bad analyst with AI produces noise faster.
A disciplined analyst uses it to locate where they might be wrong."
— Erwin Maurice McDonald, Practical Data Evangelist

# The Faith Gap Equation

## Core Diagnostic Formula

`
Faith Gap Score = f(Relationship Tenure⁻¹ × Attachment Anxiety × Breadwinner Norm Intensity)
`

Where:
- **Relationship Tenure⁻¹**  = Inverse of years together (shorter tenure = higher gap)
- **Attachment Anxiety**      = Scored 0–100 via validated attachment instruments (Hazan & Shaver 1987)
- **Breadwinner Norm Intensity** = Cultural/contextual amplifier (Gonalons-Pons & Gangl 2021, 29 countries)

## Threshold Reference

| Score | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| 0–30  | Low Faith Gap — sufficient shared history; information delivery effective |
| 31–60 | Moderate Faith Gap — attachment-informed communication indicated |
| 61–85 | High Faith Gap — couples work + structural naming required |
| 86–100 | Critical Faith Gap — professional support indicated |

## Functional Trust Floor

**Score: 50/100** — Below this, relationship stability under sustained threat

| Variable | Type 1 Score | Type 2 Score | Type 3 Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity Threat | 45 | 74 | 87 |
| Visibility Score | 38 | 61 | 74 |
| Moral Framing | 40 | 68 | 89 |
| Mindset Rigidity | 20 | 72 | 90 |
| Institutional Trust | 52 | 31 | 12 |
| Perceived Control | 45 | 18 | 9 |
| Belief Flexibility | 75 | 22 | 8 |

**Belief Flexibility Score: 75/100 (Type 1)**
→ Faith Gap Framework IS the correct intervention class
→ Information delivery works here — belief flexibility is above threshold

# DATA, ATTRIBUTION, CITATION & RIGHTS LICENSE (DACR v2.0)

**License Type:** DACR — Data, Attribution, Citation & Rights  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Effective Date:** February 26, 2026  
**Licensor:** Erwin Maurice McDonald | Practical Data Evangelist | Fort Worth, TX  

---

## Preamble

This License governs the use, citation, reproduction, adaptation, distribution,
analysis, and derivative development of the **Faith Gap Framework** — including
its white paper, diagnostic model, equations, visualizations, analytical modules,
methodology documentation, scoring outputs, citation architecture, and all
associated intellectual property (collectively, the "Framework").

The DACR License is purpose-built for behavioral science frameworks,
research models, and structured analytical intellectual property. It is
distinct from software open-source licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) because the
Framework’s value lies in its analytical structure, evidentiary synthesis,
and interpretive methodology — not merely in executable code.

DACR v2.0 is designed to:

1. Enable academic citation and educational reference with full Attribution  
2. Protect the Licensor’s intellectual property from commercial appropriation  
3. Prevent derivative frameworks from being published without written permission  
4. Preserve evidentiary and citation integrity  
5. Establish a timestamped, auditable authorship record  
6. Restrict unauthorized AI training and model ingestion  

---

## Section 1 — Definitions

**"Framework"** means the Faith Gap Framework in its entirety, including but not
limited to: the three-variable diagnostic model, the Faith Gap Equation, all seven
analytical modules (MOD 1–MOD 7), visualizations, white paper, methodology
documentation, citation architecture, truth scoring outputs, research analyzer
outputs, related variable scoring systems, and any derivative or adapted versions.

**"Licensor"** means Erwin Maurice McDonald, operating as Practical Data Evangelist,
Fort Worth, TX.

**"Licensee"** means any individual, organization, institution, or entity that
accesses, reads, downloads, references, cites, reproduces, analyzes, or uses
any portion of the Framework in any form.

**"Commercial Use"** means any use generating revenue, securing funding,
consulting engagements, paid speaking opportunities, subscription services,
or integration into revenue-generating products or services.

**"Derivative Framework"** means any model, methodology, scoring system,
equation set, diagnostic tool, or analytical architecture that substantially
incorporates, adapts, extends, modifies, abstracts, or builds upon the
Framework’s structure, variable logic, or evidentiary synthesis.

**"AI Training"** means use of the Framework as training data, fine-tuning
material, retrieval corpus, benchmark dataset, RLHF signal, evaluation
framework, prompt library, or any mechanism influencing machine learning
model behavior.

**"Attribution"** means clear, visible, and accurate credit to the Licensor
using the required citation format specified in Section 3.

# DATA, ATTRIBUTION, CITATION & RIGHTS LICENSE (DACR v1.0)

**License Type:** DACR — Data, Attribution, Citation & Rights
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** February 2026
**Licensor:** Erwin Maurice McDonald | Practical Data Evangelist | Fort Worth, TX

## Preamble

This license governs the use, citation, reproduction, adaptation, and distribution
of the **Faith Gap Framework** — including its white paper, diagnostic model,
equations, visualizations, module outputs, methodology documentation, and all
associated intellectual property (collectively, "the Framework").

The DACR License is purpose-built for behavioral science frameworks, research
models, and data-driven intellectual property. It is distinct from software
open-source licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) because the Framework's value is not
code — it is **the analytical structure, the citation architecture, and the
interpretive methodology** developed by the Licensor.

The DACR v1.0 License is designed to:

1. Enable academic citation and educational reference with full attribution
2. Protect the Licensor's intellectual property from commercial appropriation
3. Prevent derivative frameworks from being published without written permission
4. Ensure the evidentiary integrity of the Framework is preserved in all uses
5. Create a public, timestamped, auditable record of authorship and terms

---

limited to: the three-variable diagnostic model, the Faith Gap Equation, all seven
analytical modules (MOD 1–MOD 7), all FRED-style visualizations, the white paper,
the methodology documentation, the citation architecture, the KenSight v3.5 truth
scoring output, the Research Analyzer v1.0 quality audit, the Snowflake Equation
Lab v2 variable scores, and any derivative or adapted versions thereof.

**"Licensor"** means Erwin Maurice McDonald, operating as Practical Data Evangelist,
Fort Worth, TX.

**"Licensee"** means any individual, organization, institution, or entity that
accesses, reads, downloads, references, cites, reproduces, or uses any portion
of the Framework in any form.

**"Commercial Use"** means any use of the Framework, or any portion thereof, that
generates revenue, is incorporated into a paid product or service, is used to
secure funding, consulting contracts, or speaking engagements, or is used in any
capacity where financial consideration is received, directly or indirectly.

**"Derivative Framework"** means any model, methodology, scoring system, equation,
or analytical tool that substantially incorporates, adapts, extends, modifies, or
builds upon the Framework's structure, variable set, or diagnostic logic.

**"Attribution"** means clear and prominent credit to the Licensor using the
required citation format specified in Section 3 of this License.
